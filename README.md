# blog-website
With a focus on back-end, this blogging website allows users to create, read and delete posts. 

This web application was developed using Node and Express for the back-end, MongoDB for the database and embedded JavaScript templates for the front-end.

Here is a live link to the web app deployed on Heroku: https://evening-ocean-78872.herokuapp.com/

It is also connected to a live database on MongoDB Atlas.
